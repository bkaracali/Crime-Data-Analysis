# Crime-Data-Analysis

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to explore the relationships between crime rates and socioeconomic factors in a USA.

Hypothesis: Socioeconomic factors, including unemployment rates, poverty levels, education attainment, and income inequality, collectively influence crime rates in complex and multifaceted ways. Certain demographic groups may be disproportionately affected by socioeconomic disparities, leading to variations in crime trends across different regions and communities within the USA.
